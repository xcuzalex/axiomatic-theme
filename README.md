# Axiomatic Theme

A premium, high-end VS Code theme series designed for clarity, aesthetics, and long coding sessions.

## Variants

### Axiomatic Dark
A sophisticated dark theme featuring a deep, midnight blue background (`#282A36`) inspired by the classic Dracula palette but refined for a modern feel.
- **Background**: Deep midnight blue/purple for reduced eye strain.
- **Accents**: Vibrant Dracula-inspired purples (`#BD93F9`) and pinks (`#FF79C6`).
- **Text**: Soft, muted blue-grey (`#A9B1D6`) foreground for comfortable reading without the harshness of pure white.
- **Syntax**: Carefully selected colors for distinct yet harmonious syntax highlighting.

### Axiomatic Light
A clean and crisp light theme for bright environments.
*(Note: Light theme is currently in beta and shares the high-quality design philosophy of the dark variant)*
